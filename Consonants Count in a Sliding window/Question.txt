Consonants Count in a Sliding window

The program must accept an integer K and a string S containing only alphabets as the input.
The program must print the count of consonants in each sliding window of size K in the string S as the output.

Note : Optimize your program to avoid Time Limit Exceed error.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <=K <= Length of S <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains K. The second line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of consonants in each sliding window of size K in the string S.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input: 
3 pineapple

Output: 
2 1 1 1 2 3 2

Explanation: 
The sliding window size K = 3. 
1st window is pin -> 2 consonants 
2nd window is ine -> 1 consonant 
3rd window is nea -> 1 consonant 
4th window is eap -> 1 consonant 
Sth window is app -> 2 consonants 
6th window is ppl -> 3 consonants
