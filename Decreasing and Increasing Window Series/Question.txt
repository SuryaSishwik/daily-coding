Decreasing and Increasing Window Series

The program must accept two integers N and K as the input. The program must generate a
series as given below and print the Kth term as the output.
1 to N, 2*N to N+1, (2*N) +1 to 3*N, 4*N to (3*N)+1, (4*N)+1 to 5*N, . and so on.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= K <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains N and K separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the Kth term in the series.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
4 15

Output:
14

Explanation:
Here N=4 and K=15
The increasing and decreasing window series of size 4 is given below.
1 2 3 4 8 7 6 5 9 10 11 12 16 15 14 13 and so on...
The 15th term in the above series is 14. So 14 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input :
5 8

Output:
8

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
