Single File Programming Question

Problem Statement
Gurpreet is working on a programming task involving matrices. The objective is to write a program that processes a given matrix based on specific rules. The program should first accept the number of rows and columns as input. Following this, it should take a matrix of the specified size (rows x columns) as input. 
The core logic of the program should identify any row or column that contains at least one zero. Once identified, the program should modify the matrix by replacing every element in these rows and columns with zeros.
The final output should be the modified matrix, where all rows and columns that originally contained at least one zero element are filled with zeros.

Input format :
The first line consists of two integers r and c, separated by a space, representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
The next r lines contain c space-separated integers, representing the elements of the matrix.
Output format :
If there are zeros in the matrix, display the modified matrix after replacing rows and columns with zeros if any element in the row or column is zero. If there are no zeros in the matrix, display the given matrix as it is.
Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
In the given scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:
2 ≤ r, c ≤ 8
0 ≤ elements ≤ 9
