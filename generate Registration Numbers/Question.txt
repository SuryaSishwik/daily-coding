generate Registration Numbers

The function/method generator accepts four arguments year, section, N and D. The
first argument year represents the batch of a class. The second argument section represents
the section of the class. The third argument N represents the number of students in the class.

The four argument D represents an integer value.
The function/method generator must generate the registration number for each
student in the class based on the following condition.DE
 - Each registration number has three parts P1, P2, and P3, where P1 = year, P2 = section, P3 =
numbers from 1 to N in D digits.

Then the function must return a string containing the N registration numbers separated by a
space.

Note: The value of D is always greater than or equal to the number of digits in N.

Your task is to implement the function generator so that the program runs
Successfully,

IMPORTANT: Use The main() function, Which is given below.

int main()
{
    int year, N, D;
    char section;
    scanf("%d %c %d %d", &year, &section, &N, &D) ;
    char *str = generator(year, section, N, D);

    if (str == NULL)
    printf( "String is not formed\n");
    if (str [0] == '\0' || str[0] == ' ')

    printf( "String is empty \n");
    printf("%s", str);
    return 0;
}

Boundary Condition(s):
1000 < = year <= 9999
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= D <=5

Example Input/Output 1:
Input
2021 C 5 3
Output:
2021C001 2021C002 2021C003 2021C004 2021C005

Explanation:
Year = 2021, Section = C, Number of students = 5 and D = 3.
So the registration numbers of the 5 students in the class are generated as given below.
2021C001
2021CO02
2021C003
2021C004
2021C005

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1995 A 6 2

Output
1995A01 1995A02 1995A03 1995A04 1995A05 1995A06

Max Execution Time Limit: 150 millisecs
