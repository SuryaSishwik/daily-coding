Count The Recursive Ones

The program must accept a string S containing only Os and 1s as the input. The program must
print the number of 1s in the given string S. Then the program must print the number of 1s in
the previous result(i.e., the ones count in the binary representation of the previous result).
Then the program must repeat the process till the number of 1s in the result reaches 1.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the integer values separated by a space representing the number of 1s
based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
1000100101011000101110101111

Output:
15 4 1

Explanation:
Here S = "100010010101 1000101110101111".
There are 15 ones in the given string S. So 15 is printed.
15 -> 1111 -> 4 ones. So 4 is printed.
4-> 100 -> 1 one. So 1 is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
1101101111101110111111010,

Output:
19 3 2 1

Max Execution Time Limit: 500 millisecs
