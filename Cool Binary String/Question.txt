Cool Binary String

The program must accept a string S containing only 1s and 0s as the input. The program must 
print Yes if the given string is a cool binary string. Else the program must print No as the
output.
A cool binary string must satisfy the following two conditions.
    - The number of is must be equal to the number of Os.
    - In each prefix of the string, the number of 1s must be greater than or equal to 
      the number of 0s in the prefix.

Hint: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceeded Error.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 10^3

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains Yes or No.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
110010

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
Here S = "110010".
The number of 1s in S = 3.
The number of Os in S = 3.
In each prefix of S, the number of 1s is greater than or equal to the number of 0s.
1st prefix: 1
2nd prefix: 11
3rd prefix: 110
4th prefix: 1100
5th prefix: 11001
6th prefix: 110010
Hence Yes is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
11010

Output:
No

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
1001

Output:
No

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
