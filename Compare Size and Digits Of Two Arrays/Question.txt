Compare Size and Digits Of Two Arrays

The program must accept two integer arrays A1 and A2 as the input. The program must print
YES if both arrays have the same size and the same digits used to form integers, Else the
program must print NO as the output. Then the program must print the sum of integers in the
arrays A1 and A2 as the output.

Note: The maximum size of both arrays Al and A2 is 100.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^4

Input Format:
The first line contains integer values separated by a space representing the array A1.
The second line contains integer values separated by a space representing the array A2.

Output Format:
The first line contains YES or NO.DEC LEC 19336@ RMDEC UEC19336@RMDEC UEC19336@
The second line contains the sum of integers in the arrays A1 and A2 separated by a space
only if YES is printed.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
12 801 6 8100
88 61000 1 21

Output:
YES
8919 61110

Explanation:
Both arrays A1 and A2 have an equal size 4.
The same digits are used in both arrays.
So YES is printed as the output.
The sum of integers in A1 is 8919.
The sum of integers in A2 is 61110.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
16 98 12 98 456 21
12 456 9898 16 21

Output:
NO

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
71 571
757 71

Output:
NO

Explanation:
Both arrays A1 and A2 have an equal size 2.
The 2 integers in A1 are formed using two 7s, two is and one 5.
The 2 integers in A2 are formed using three 7s, one 1 and one 5.
Hence NO is printed as the output.

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
