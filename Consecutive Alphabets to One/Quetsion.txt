The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must
replace all the consecutive occurrences of the alphabets(ignoring case) with 1s and all the other
remaining alphabets with Os. Finally, the program must print the decimal equivalent of S by
considering it as a binary representation.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <=50
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value based on the given conditions.
