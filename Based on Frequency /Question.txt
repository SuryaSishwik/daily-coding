Based on Frequency Expand The Frequency

In a string compression technique, a string can be compressed based on the following
condition.
-If a character occurs consecutively(possibly once) in the string, then those characters must
be replaced with the single character and the frequency of the character till that position in
the string.
For example,
aaabboccaaabbb can be compressed as a362c3a6b5.
abcabcabcc can be compressed as a1bic1a2b2c2a4b4c4.
The program must accept a string S representing a compressed string as the input. The
program must expand the given string and print the original string as the output

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the expanded string based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
a3b3c3a6

Output:
aaabbbcccaaa

Explanation:
a3 -> aaa
b3 -> bbb
c3 -> CCC
a6 -> aaa (already the character 'a' has occurred thrice before)

Example Input/Output 2:

Input
x5y2z1x6y3z6

Output:
xxxxxyyzxyzzzzz

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
