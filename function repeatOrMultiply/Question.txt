function repeatOrMultiply

The function/method repeatOrMultiply accepts an argument str. The string str contains two
positive integers(X, Y) separated by an asterisk or a word(W) and a positive integer(N)
separated by an asterisk.

The function/method repeatOrMultiply must return a string based on the following
conditions.
-If the given string contains two integers, then the function must return their product as a
 string.
-Else the function must form a string by repeating the word N times. Then the function must
return the resulting string.

Your task is to implement the function repeatOrMultiply so that the program runs
successfully.

IMPORTANT: Use the main() function, Which is defined below.

int main()
{
    char str[101];
    scanf("%s", str);
    char *result = repeatOrMultiply(str) ;
    if(result == NULL || result == str)
    {
        printf("String is not formed\n");
    }
    if (result [0] == '\0' || result[0] == ' ')
    {
        printf( "String is empty\n");
    }
    printf("%s", result);
    return 0;
}

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
15*120

Output:
1800

Explanation:
The given string contains two integers(15 and 120) separated by an asterisk.
So their product is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
Skill*4

Output:
SkillSkillSkillSkill

Explanation:
The given string contains a word and an integer("Skill" and 4) separated by an asterisk.
So the word "Skill" is repeated 4 times.

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
10*CSE

Output:
CSECSECSECSECSECSECSECSECSECSE

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
